\title{Build orthogroups from RBH pairs using connected components}
\usage{
build_orthogroups_from_rbh(rbh_pairs, all_protein_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{rbh_pairs}{A tibble with columns: protein_a, protein_b}

\item{all_protein_ids}{Character vector of all protein IDs (for identifying singletons)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: orthogroup_id, protein_id
Only proteins in orthogroups are returned (singletons excluded)
}
\description{
Groups proteins into orthogroups based on RBH relationships.
Proteins connected through any chain of RBH pairs form one orthogroup.
