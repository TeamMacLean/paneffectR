# paneffectR: Comparative Genomics of Effector Proteins Across Genome Assemblies

Clusters proteins from multiple genome assemblies into ortholog groups,
builds presence/absence matrices, and generates publication-ready
visualizations. Designed for effector protein analysis from the omnieff
pipeline but works with any protein sets.
